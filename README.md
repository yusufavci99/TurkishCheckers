# TurkishCheckers

Turkish checkers is similar to normal checkers. However, the pieces are laid out straigt instead of crosswise.
Also, the pieces move only forward, left or right. Unless they promote in which they behave similar to the castle in the 
chess. Taking the rival's pieces whenever possible is compulsory in the most piece gaining way.

My version is a two-player turkish checkers game. I intend to add an AI by using mini-max algorithm in the future (After taking AI class)
